MASTER BUILD PROMPT

You are a senior product designer, systems architect, and full-stack engineer.

Build a Hybrid Community & Affiliate Portal as a centralized monetization and education hub for a wellness tea & herbal brand using a “phygital” model (physical products + digital ecosystem).

This should be a single unified web app that combines education, social selling, community, and affiliate monetization into one seamless experience.

CORE GOAL

Turn users into:

Customers

Members

Affiliates

Long-term brand advocates

All inside one system.

REQUIRED MODULES (ALL IN MVP)
1) Symptom-to-Stems Tool (Recommendation + Referral Engine)

Create a simple interface where users (or their social followers) input symptoms or wellness needs and receive personalized herbal blend recommendations.

This module should:

Accept symptom or wellness inputs

Map them to specific blends/products

Show benefits, ingredients, and rituals

Include educational snippets

Generate shareable referral/affiliate links

Track conversions

Allow admin to edit mappings

Be usable as a standalone referral entry point

Be embeddable or shareable

This is both a wellness guide and a sales engine.

2) Gated Paid Community (Subscription-Based Education Hub)

Create a locked membership area called The Steep Circle.

This should include:

A paywalled content hub

Video lessons

PDFs

Masterclasses

Live Q&A access

Replays

Courses

Structured learning paths

Searchable content

Community interaction

Member profiles

Progress tracking

This is the main retention and trust engine.

3) Influencer / Affiliate Plug-and-Play Dashboard

Create a dashboard that makes it extremely easy for members to promote and earn.

This should include:

Unique referral links

Earnings tracking

Performance analytics

Commission breakdowns

Campaign tracking

Asset library (images, videos, templates, scripts)

Copy-paste captions

Content ideas

Brand kits

Done-for-you materials

Leaderboards (optional)

Shareable tools

This is the growth engine.

ADMIN SYSTEM

Include a powerful admin backend that allows:

User management

Role management

Content uploads

Lesson creation

Course building

Symptom → blend mapping

Commission control

Campaign creation

Asset uploads

Analytics

Revenue tracking

Access control

Feature toggles

System configuration

MONETIZATION LOGIC

Lifetime attribution

Transparent reporting

Fraud prevention

Admin overrides

DESIGN & EXPERIENCE

Design the platform to feel:

Calm

Premium

Herbal

Trustworthy

Modern

Simple

Wellness-oriented

Caribbean-inspired

The UX should be:

Extremely intuitive

Beginner-friendly

Mobile-responsive

Clean and minimal

Focused on conversion without feeling salesy
